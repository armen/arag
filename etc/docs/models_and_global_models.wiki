==== Models and Global Models ====

Models are exactly same as what they are in Kohana, the only difference is the location of related files. In general, models are located at "webapp/modules/<module_name>/models/<model_name>.php".

You can load models in same way you do in Kohana but it has some additional tricks:

  $this->load->model('ExampleModel');

This will load a model called 'ExampleModel' in current module. But what if you want to specify a calling name too? Just send it as a parameter as following example:

  $this->load->model('ModelName', 'CallingName');

You can also load models from other modules simply like this:

  $this->load->model('ModelName', 'CallingName', 'ModuleName');

In both above examples if the called model doesn't exist, the loader will try to load a global model from "webapp/models/" directory. Simple, isn't it?!
