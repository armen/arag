== Models ==

Models are exactly same as what they are in Kohana, the only difference is the location of related files. In general, models are located at "webapp/modules/<module_name>/models/<model_name>.php".

You can load models in same way you do in Kohana but it has an additional trick:

{{{
  $model = new ModelName_Model;
}}}

This will load a model called '!ModelName_Model' in current module. But what if you want to call it from other module than current module?.

{{{
  $model = Model::load('ModelName', 'module_name');
}}}
