==== Templates (Views) ====

Don't worry, there is nothing new here except that in Arag, You can use smarty templates as your view.

Lets have a closer look at it. For example you can have a file called "index.php" and another one "index.tpl" and simply load the view with following code:

  $this->load->view('index');

or

  $view = new View('index');

If Smarty integration is enabled in "webapp/config/smarty.php", loader will load "index.tpl" file otherwise it will load "index.php".
In ".tpl" files you can use Smarty templates engine language, Smarty plugins and helpers.
