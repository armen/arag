==== Installation Instructions ====

=== Installing from SVN ===

1) Checkout a copy from SVN:
<code bash>
  svn checkout svn://svn.osp.ir/svnroot/arag/trunk arag  
</code>
2) Download third party libraries:
<code bash>
  ./arag/etc/scripts/get_third_party.sh
</code>

This command simply downloads and extracts the "Kohana 2.0" and moves the system directory content to "libs/kohana" then it downloads and extracts the "Smarty-2.6.18" and moves libs directory content to "libs/smarty".

3) Set "webapp/cache" directory to be writeable by your web server:
<code bash>
  chmod 777 arag/webapp/cache/
</code>
