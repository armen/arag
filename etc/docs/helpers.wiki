==== Helpers ====

When Smarty integration is enabled, helpers are not accessible in Smarty templates. But we can implement some Smarty plugins as wrappers between Smarty and helper functions in "applications/arag/helpers/<helper_name>" directory. We implemented some helper wrappers for you, so if you load a helper and it was accessible in Smarty templates, it shows it is implemented before, otherwise you have to write it yourself. Writing a wrapper is very simple. You can checkout "applications/arag/helpers/url/function.anchore.php" or any existing wrapper source code available at "applications/arag/helpers/" folder to understand "How to write a wrapper yourself in 24 seconds" :P.

Each helper will be accessible in Smarty templates as simple as writing (in this case we are using html::anchor wrapper):

  {html_anchor uri="example/test/sample_id"}

If Smarty throws an error you have to handle it yourself as described :).
